Faced with massive debts, the master decided to sell the ruby, using the maid as a messenger to contact an antique dealer.
<br>
Instead of openly selling the ruby, he staged an internal theft to disguise his financial troubles, making it seem as if the gem had been stolen rather than willingly sold.
<br>
The butler sensed something was wrong and had been secretly investigating, but he couldn't stop the master's actions.
