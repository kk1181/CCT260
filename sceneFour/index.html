                <p>The butler admits he had long been aware of the master's financial troubles and had been secretly investigating.</p>
                <p>Since he uses the same cologne daily, the scent at the crime scene was simply a remnant from his previous visits, not proof of guilt.</p>
                <p>The debt note found in his desk confirms his knowledge of the master's crisis, but he had not disclosed it to anyone; instead, he was gathering evidence to prevent further trouble.</p>
                <p>This proves that the butler is not the culprit. He was trying to protect the estate's assets.</p>

            <div id="maid-description" class="description-box">
                <p>The maid admits that the master instructed her to deliver a letter to an antique dealer during her grocery trip.</p>
                <p>The letter contained details about the plan to sell the ruby, as the master sought to pay off his massive debts.</p>
                <p>The maid obeyed out of fear but was unaware of the letter's true contents until the cat detective discovered it in her basket.</p>
                <p>This confirms that the maid was not a willing accomplice. She was merely used by the master.</p>
