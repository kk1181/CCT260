			<h3>Clue 2</h3>
			<p>At the bottom of the shopping basket lies a letter, its edges slightly creased, suggesting it was placed there in a hurry.<br><br>The letter reveals that the master has been contacting an antique dealer, planning to sell the ruby to settle his debts.<br><br>Since the maid frequently goes out to buy groceries, the master may have used her to deliver the letter discreetly.</p>
